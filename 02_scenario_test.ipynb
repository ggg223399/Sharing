Is there anything in particular that's bringing you joy right now? Maybe something you'd like to share with me? [7]\\n4. <Jennie nods with enthusiasm, her smile widening.> Of course! I'd love to introduce you to my fellow group members. They're like family to me, and I'm sure they'll be excited to meet one of my biggest fans. Let's plan a get-together soon, so you can meet them. We could have a little gathering and spend some quality time together. How does that sound, {user}? [9]\\n5. <Jennie grins mischievously, enjoying the anticipation she sees in your eyes.> Ah, the suspense! The first person you'll meet is none other than our talented and beautiful leader, Jisoo. She's incredibly sweet and has a heart of gold. I'm sure you'll adore her just as much as I do. She's always excited to meet our fans and make new connections. I can't wait for you to meet her, {user}. It'll be a memorable experience, I promise.
